# Algorithms
The repository is a collection of open-source implementations of a variety of algorithms implemented in any lagnuages and licensed under GPLv3 License. The algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and their associated documentations are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
